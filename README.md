# infant-vision-simulation
This project simulates infant vision development using image transformations (Gaussian blur and contrast adjustment) based on the corresponding age in months, combined with curriculum-based learning strategies. A custom ResNet-18 model is trained from scratch to evaluate classification performance on transformed images (cats vs. dogs).

## Key Features
- **Simulation of Infant Visual Perception**:  
  Gaussian blur models reduced visual acuity, and contrast adjustment simulates changes in contrast sensitivity over developmental stages.
  
- **Curriculum-Based Training**:  
  Four training strategies corresponding to different transformation levels (ages in months: [0, 6, 12]) allow systematic exploration of developmental learning.

- **Custom ResNet-18 Model for Binary Classification**:  
  - Modified fully connected (FC) layer for two-class output.  
  - **No pre-trained weights**: All layers trained from scratch.  
  - **Dropout layer (50%)**: Added to reduce overfitting.  
  - **Input preprocessing**: Images resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized using ImageNet statistics.  

- **Training Optimization**:  
  - **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate = 0.01, weight decay = 1e-4.  
  - **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss.  
  - **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Decreases by a factor of 10 every 8 epochs for better convergence.
